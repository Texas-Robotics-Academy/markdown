# Exercise 3: Variables and a few robot functions


## Exercise 3.1:

cd into the ex3 directory.

- Write a short program. The program should print something like this on the screen.

```
X:
Y:
Area: 
```

- Create doubles x, y, and area.
- Print the "X:" and then use cin to store a value in x.
- Print the "Y:" and then use cin to store a value in y.
- Multiply x * y, and store the result in area.
- Print the "Area: " and then print the value stored in your variable "area."

## Exercise 3.2:

Go to your Arduino IDE.U se the File/Save As menu item to save ex2_3 as ex3_2, so that your directory structure looks like

ex3
ex3/ex3_2

Write your loop so that it:

- Prints "Texas Robotics" on LCD1, and "Academy" on LCD2.
- Delays 1000

- Prints "Hook 'em" on LCD1, and "Horns" on LCD2.
- Delays 1000
