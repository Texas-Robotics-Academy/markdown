# Exercise 8: Turn & Push

## Exercise 8.1: Reading the Obstacle Sensors
In Exercise 5.1, you read the range sensors on the robot. Now, we will use them to control the robot.

- Make a directory called ex8.
- Save ex7_1 as ex8_1.
- Comment out menu.buttonPress, menu.runMotors, and menu.PrintMenu() from loop()
  - Basically all of the code in loop() - yes - but you'll need it later.
