# Exercise 5: Range Sensors


## Exercise 5.1:

Save ex4_2 as ex5.

Write a short program.
- ~~In setup() use one.obstacleSensorsEmitters(const bool state) to turn on the obstacle sensors~~
- Use one.readLeftRangeSensor() and one.readRightRangeSensor() to read the two range sensors
- Print the values on LCD 1 and LCD 2
- Place your robot so that it is facing a wall
- Use a Phillips-head screwdriver to make it so the two range sensors read roughly the same value when the robot faces the wall head-on (so they are the same distance away)
