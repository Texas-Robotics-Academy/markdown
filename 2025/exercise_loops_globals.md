# Exercise 4: Loops and Global Variables


## Exercise 4.1:

cd into the ex4 directory.

Write a short program using a for loop, an if statement, an else if statement, and an else statement.
- Using for, count from 0 to 10 in variable "i"
- Inside the loop
  - If i is less than 10 print "< the value stored in i, not this text > is less than 10"
  - If i is equal to 10 print "< the value stored in i, not this text > equals 10"
  - If i is greater than 10 print "< the value stored in i, not this text > is greater than 10"

## Exercise 4.2:

Go to your Arduino IDE. Use the File/Save As menu item to save ex3_3 as ex4_2.

- Make a global variable called counter, and set it to zero.
- Use a String type and the String() function to store a string that says, "Counter: < the value stored in counter >."
- Print this string on LCD 1.
- Increment counter at the end of your loop()
