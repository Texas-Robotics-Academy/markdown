## Git

Git is a version control system. It allows multiple programmers to collaborate on long-term projects by synchronizing code across their machines. We will be using git to provide a file structure for the C++ and robot programming exercises. Let's go ahead and clone (copy to our local machine) the C++ exercises.


{{site.data.alerts.terminal_commands}}
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/texas-robocamp/cpp_exercises.git
{{site.data.alerts.terminal_commands_end}}
