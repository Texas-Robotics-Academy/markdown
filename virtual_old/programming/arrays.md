# Arrays

Sometimes we want to store lists of data together in one place. For example, it might be handy to have a list of all your grades from science class. You could go back later and average all the grades in the list together to find out your final grade in science. In C++, such lists are called **arrays**

You can think of an **array** like a motel. Let's begin by imagining a single-story motel complex. The rooms are laid out in a row right next to each other. If you stand in front of room 7, you know that room 8 will be right next door, and room 9 will be after room 8. Arrays work in the same way. We can put values inside each of the "rooms" in the array, and since they are numbered logically, we can quickly find any "room" we need.

When you build a motel, you have to decide ahead of time how many rooms you want there to be, and you can't change your mind after the motel is built (without paying a lot of construction costs). In a C++ array, at the beginning of the function you declare the **type**, **name**, and **size** of your array upfront. Going back to the science grade example, we would declare a science grade array like this:

```cpp
float gradeArray[5];
```

The brackets with the number mean that we are constructing an array that is five units in length named `gradeArray`. We declare it as a float because we plan on storing floating point numbers in each of the "rooms" in the array. We can substitute the number 5 with any length of array we want, but once we declare our array to be a certain size, **we can't change it**.

Now that we've declared an array, we need to put things inside it. Inside our main function, we'll enter five grades into the array. When you put a value into an array, you have to tell the computer where to put it, just like the front desk in a motel would assign you a room. Like rooms in a motel, locations, or elements, in an array are numberedâ€”in an array, though, the numbers are from 0 to one less than the size of the array. In `gradeArray`, then, there are five elements, which are numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. We talk about a specific elements of an array by writing the name of the array and then putting the location number in brackets, like this: `gradeArray[0]` . Let's put some values into them in the following code:

{{ site.data.alerts.callout_code_div }}
```
gradeArray[0] = 98.3;
gradeArray[1] = 91.1;
gradeArray[2] = 89.8;
gradeArray[3] = 90.5;
gradeArray[4] = 95.0;
```
{{ site.data.alerts.end }}

Now that we have our grades in an array, we want to calculate our final grade by averaging them all together. To do so, we need to visit each element in the array (imagine going from door to door in a motel) and add together the values in each position. Finally, we need to divide them by the number of values in the array. To do this systematically, we can use a for loop. We will loop through each element in the array and add its value to a variable called `gradeSum` that we initialize ahead of time. After we finish the loop, we will divide `gradeSum` by 5 to get the average. Here's the code for this program:

{{ site.data.alerts.callout_code_div }}
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
   //declare the array and the other variables
   float gradeArray[5];
   float gradeSum, gradeAverage;
   int i;

   //put some grades into the array
   gradeArray[0] = 98.3;
   gradeArray[1] = 91.1;
   gradeArray[2] = 89.8;
   gradeArray[3] = 90.5;
   gradeArray[4] = 95.0;

   //initialize the gradeSum variable to be 0
   gradeSum = 0;

   //loop through each location in gradeArray (there are 5)
   for(i=0; i<5; i++){
      //add the value of the thing stored at location
      //i in gradeArray to gradeSum
      gradeSum += gradeArray[i];
   }

   //to finish the average, divide gradeSum by 5
   gradeAverage = gradeSum/5;

   //print out the average
   cout << "Your science class average is " << gradeAverage << ".\n";
   return 0;
}
```
{{ site.data.alerts.end }}

### Exercise 3.7.1:

- Change the program above so that it stores and uses 7 grades instead of 5 to calculate the average.

Yay! Two more :)

### Exercise 3.7.2:

Write a program that asks a user to enter 10 numbers, puts those numbers in an array, and then prints out the numbers in the array backwards? Hint: use a loop that counts backwards.

Almost there!

## Multidimensional Arrays

One really cool feature of arrays is that you can have **multidimensional arrays**. Let's return to the motel example from earlier, where we had a one-story motel. Imagine that we add a second floor to the motel of exactly the same length as the ground floor. Let's pretend we had to give a motel guest directions to their room. We would start by telling them the floor that they were on, and then which room on that floor was theirs. Multi-dimensional arrays work the same way, except the floors are numbered from 0. To make this a little clearer, consider this diagram below, which represents an array called `letterArray`:

|row/col|0|1|2|3|4|
|-------|-|-|-|-|-|
|0      | |y| | |w|
|1      | | |x| | |
|2      | |z| | | |

We can see that the position of the letter w is row 0, column 4. We can write this position as `letterArray[0][4]`. The position of letter x is row 1, column 2, so we write that as `letterArray[1][2]`. Remember, row first, then column.

You can use a multidimensional array in exactly the same way as a one-dimensional array, and you can assign values the same way, too:

```cpp
letterArray[3][1]='a';
```

To declare a 3x3 multidimensional array of chars, you would do:

```cpp
char letterArray[3][3];
```

### Exercise 3.7.3:

Determine the correct code to access the elements containing letters y and z in the diagram above.
