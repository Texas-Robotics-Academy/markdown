# Bonus ROS Tutorials

Some of you have already completed the race. We have some bonus content available for you.

We've had a couple of you mention wanting to build your own robot in Gazebo. The real first step to that is working with ROS.

The counselors in your breakout have probably already begun to work through the ROS material. ROS.org has tutorials posted on their site.

They can be found at: [http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials).

We'll use this page to track your progress, as well as mark what material is worth doing.

Not all of the ROS.org material is likely to come up while you are using ROS. Let's only do the following tutorials.
