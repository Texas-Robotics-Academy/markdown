Texas RoboCamp welcomes campers with multiple levels of experience. As a result, some of you are probably ahead of the group. That's okay!

We invite you to try challenging interesting stuff with your robot.

For groups who are way ahead, we'd like you to <u>start</u> your journey by learning to use git. Proceed to the [git tutorial](/git.html).

## LEDS and FastLED

We've purchased enough LEDs for each team to attach up to 10 LEDs to their robot. These LEDs are WS2812B full-color RGB LED modules mounted on a self-adhesive flexible PCB strip. They can be cut apart and stuck to any part of your robot, though we have a suggested project or two. You can incorporate these LEDs into your other tutorials, adding a bit of flair to the way you do things. 

Want to do this? Proceed to ["Using LEDs"](led.html)

<!--## Infrared Signals

You can control the infrared LEDs and phototransistors on the robot to do custom projects either to remotely control the robot or do something entirely different that you've come up with. We'd potentially like to hack the system so that these can be used to signal the start of head-to-head races between the robots. If you'd be interested in helping us develop that, then this may be a good place to start.

## Playing Music and Sounds

The robot does in fact have a tiny speaker on it, and it can play either simple music using the `tone` command from the Arduino library, or potentially more complicated sounds (though, be wary, as you may run out of memory).
