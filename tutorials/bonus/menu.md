### Exercise 4.2.6

We want you to try out a few of the things that you've seen so far so you can use them in your programs. In particular, we want you to try out global variables and `switch` statements.

We also want you to be able to select between multiple options in the programs that you write by using the buttons on the side of the robot.

So, we'll have you write a short program that allows users to select between multiple options on the LCD screen.

- Make a global variable `int menuItem`.
- When PB1 is pressed, its value should go up.
- When PB3 is pressed, its value should go down.
- Display the value on the first line of the LCD.

### Exercise 4.2.7

- Modify your program so that when PB2 is pressed, the value should be displayed on the second line of the LCD rather than the first.
