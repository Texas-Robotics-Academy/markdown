## Overview

C++ is a programming language. It most of the applications you use are written in C++ or a similar language. You will write the programs to control your robot in C++. Like a spoken language, a programming language has a vocabulary and grammar rules. A C++ program can be thought of as a list of instructions, in order, for the computer to carry out.

To program, first create a step-by-step plan for how the computer will do what you want it to do. This plan is an algorithm.

For example, an algorithm for making a bowl of cereal might be:

- Take a bowl from the cabinet
- Place it on the counter
- Take out a box of cereal from the cabinet
- Open the box of cereal
- Pour the cereal from the box into the bowl until it almost reaches the top of the bowl
- Close the box
- Put the box back in the cabinet
- Open the fridge
- Take the milk from the fridge
- Open the milk
- Pour milk into the bowl until the cereal reaches the top of the bowl
- Close the milk
- Put the milk back into the fridge
- Take a spoon from the silverware drawer
- Put the spoon into the bowl

Algorithms are detailed and exact. When you program, the language will enforce this.
