## Finding your Machine

With your partner and your box, go to the row labeled with your team number and names. You and your partner should each choose chairs at machines next to each other along your row.  Seat as ordered on your team chart. So, the person with the name at the top will go to the machine at the far end of the row, the second person will go to the machine next to them, and so forth.

## Introduction to Linux

The computers in this lab use the Linux operating system. Linux offers a variety of free easy-to-use tools for software development that will help us along our way in constructing and programming our robots.

### Logging In

1. Enter the user name given to you, and hit Enter.
2. On the next screen, first click on the gear and select "ubuntu" from the menu.
3. Type in the password assigned to you, hit Enter, and you should be taken to a desktop screen.
4. A box will pop up telling you about keyboard shortcuts. Click the X and move on to the interesting stuff.

### Getting to a Web Browser

By default, the Ubuntu logo will be displayed on the launcher to the left of the monitor in the upper left-hand corner.

1. Click on the Ubuntu logo icon.

  * This will open the "lens".
