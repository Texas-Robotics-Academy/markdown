For this part of the guide, we'll be following Bot'n'roll's detailed  [assembly guide](/assets/botnroll-one-a-w-line-follower-assembly-manual.pdf). We have some extra tips and tricks paired up with the numbered sections.

{% include note.html content="This assembly guide is specially prepared for Texas RoboCamp and includes instructions on assembling the line follower. The default manual from the Bot'n'roll site won't have these steps, so be sure you are using our version!" %}
