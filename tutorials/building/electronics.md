For this part of the tutorials, you'll follow the steps in sections 4.2 through 4.3.10 of the [assembly guide](). [This guide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJbBQHVmTgY) gives extra camera angles and advice. We recommend you watch it before beginning to assemble the electronics for your robot.

## TODO

Don't connect the fuse just yet

When placing the 3 x 2 pin header, be sure to place the short end into the PCB.

## 4.3.2: Checkpoint X

Don't turn on the board yet. Check in so we can praise your solder work and catch any accidental shorts that might fry your robot.

The camp staff will help you use a [multimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter) to check that the 5V, 3.3V and VIN voltages are correct.

## 4.3.6: Line follower placement

The red line follower board has numbering running across it. Be sure that 0 is placed on the left side of the robot.

We are using the **front** placement.
