# Welcome to the Texas Robotics Academy!

{{ site.data.alerts.welcome }}
We're all excited to start programming the robots!
{{ site.data.alerts.end }}

You should be seated at a workstation next to your partner.

This week you will go through a mostly self-paced tutorial, programming your robot.

The tutorial will be interspersed with instruction, challenges and activities on the robot, and activities like talks from scientists.

{{ site.data.alerts.note }}
We have done everything that we could think of to pack as much fun as possible into this week.

# Cups
At this time, you should place your pair of cups on top of the computer monitor in front of you, with the blue cup facing up.
* When the red cup is facing upward, it means:
   * I need help.
   * I have completed something, and am ready for camp staff to mark my progress.
* When the blue cup is facing upward, it means:
  * Neither of those two things is currently true.

{{ site.data.alerts.note }}
Each team should use only 1 pair of cups.

# Programming your Robot and Marking Progress!
1. This site contains self-paced tutorials and challenges.
    * Your task is to *try* everything first.
    * Every few hours, Dr. Hart will *teach* material in a classroom setting.
2. At the bottom of each tutorial, challenge, or other activity, there is a checkpoint.
    * Button 1 - Requests help on the exercise.
    * Button 2 - Indicates that you are ready to have your exercise checked.
    * Button 3 - Indicates that a counselor has checked off your exercise (which is why you can't press it).
{{+}}Checkpoint 1, 0{{+}}
3. Each checkpoint must be checked by a counselor to be considered "complete."
    * You will show the counselor your working robot and/or code.
    * You may proceed to tutorials further along in the academy material while waiting for your work to be checked.

{{ site.data.alerts.callout_red_cup }}
You should also flip your code to *red* when you are ready for your code to be checked or when you need help.

Please hit the *Ready to Check* button and flip your cup to *red* now.

The counselors will not come directly to you, but we will set the tone for how this process works.
{{ site.data.alerts.end }}

{{ site.data.alerts.warning }}
It may be tempting to skip activities because you believe that you already understand them.

If you already understand them, then they will be very quick for you to complete.

Please *do* all of the activities, just in case they are actually helpful in completing the challenges.

# Command Line Instructions

Sometimes we just want you to type something into the computer and we just tell you what it is. You should literally copy-paste these commands when you see a box like this. The commands below are just an example, and are harmless, but not productive.

{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands }}
cd
ls
pwd
{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands_end }}


# Pair Programming

Pair programming when two people work together to solve a programming problem. 

You and your teammates work together to program your robot. That means that you should be programming together, not writing programs separately.

You should spend roughly equal time "driving," typing at the computer. 

{{ site.data.alerts.note }}
Try to change drivers every 30 minutes.
{{ site.data.alerts.end }}

{{ site.data.alerts.note }}
Feel free to use one account on texas-robotics-academy.com, or one for each teammate; but please let the counselors know so they can check you off!
