# Welcome to the Texas Robotics Academy!

{{ site.data.alerts.welcome }}
{{ site.data.alerts.end }}

You should be seated at a workstation, with your partner at the next workstation over.

You will go through a mostly self-paced tutorial, programming your robot.

The tutorial will be interspersed with instruction, challenges and activities on the robot, and activities like talks from scientists.

{{ site.data.alerts.note }}
This is a fun week!

# Seating

Every time you enter the lab, your assigned seat will change.

Look for the sign indicating where you should sit every time you enter into the lab.

# Cups
At this time, you should place your pair of cups on top of the computer monitor in front of you, with the blue cup facing up.
* When the red cup is facing upward, it means:
   * I need help.
   * I have completed something, and am ready for camp staff to mark my progress.
* When the blue cup is facing upward, it means:
  * Neither of those two things is currently true.

{{ site.data.alerts.note }}
Each team should use only 1 pair of cups.

# Programming your Robot and Marking Progress!
1. Tutorials
    * *Try* everything first.
    * Every few hours, Dr. Hart will *teach* material in a classroom setting.
2. At the bottom of each activity, there is a checkpoint.
    * Button 1 - Request help.
    * Button 2 - You are ready to be checked.
    * Button 3 - You have completed the exercise.
{{+}}Checkpoint 1, 0{{+}}
3. Only a counselor can mark you "complete."
    * You will show the counselor your working robot and/or code.
    * You may do tutorials further along while waiting for your work to be checked.

{{ site.data.alerts.callout_red_cup }}
Flip your code to *red* when you are ready for your code to be checked or when you need help.

Hit *Ready to Check* and flip your cup to *red* now.

The counselors will not come directly to you.
{{ site.data.alerts.end }}

{{ site.data.alerts.warning }}
It is tempting to skip activities because already understand them.

If you already understand them, they will be very quick for you to complete.

Please *do* all of the activities.

# Command Line Instructions

You should literally copy-paste these commands when you see a box like this.

{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands }}
cd
ls
pwd
{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands_end }}


# Pair Programming

When working on the robots, write your programs together with your partner.

Do the C++ tutorials (with no robot) alone.

You should spend roughly equal time typing at the computer.

Try to change drivers every 30 minutes.
