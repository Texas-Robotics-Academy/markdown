# Welcome to the Texas Robotics Academy!

{{ site.data.alerts.welcome }}
We're all excited to start programming the robots!
{{ site.data.alerts.end }}

{{ site.data.alerts.note }}
At the start of every coding session, you will be instructed to go into breakout rooms.
    * Wait until you are told to go into your breakout room at the start of each session, as sometimes we will have announcements or lectures.
    * This room will change *every* session.
    * Please join the breakout that you are instructed to join.

# Programming your Robot and Marking Progress!
1. This site contains self-paced tutorials and challenges.
    * Your task is to *try* everything first.
    * Every few hours, Dr. Hart will *teach* material in a classroom setting.
2. At the bottom of each tutorial, challenge, or other activity, there is a checkpoint.
    * Button 1 - Requests help on the exercise.
    * Button 2 - Indicates that you are ready to have your exercise checked.
    * Button 3 - Indicates that a counselor has checked off your exercise (which is why you can't press it).
{{+}}Checkpoint 1, 1{{+}}
3. Each checkpoint must be checked by a counselor to be considered "complete."
    * You will show the counselor your working robot and/or code.
    * You may proceed to tutorials further along in the academy material while waiting for your work to be checked.


{{ site.data.alerts.note }}
Please mark *Checkpoint 1* as "Ready to Check" now.
{{ site.data.alerts.end }}

{{ site.data.alerts.warning }}
It may be tempting to skip activities because you believe that you already understand them.

If you already understand them, then they will be very quick for you to complete.

Please *do* all of the activities, just in case they are actually helpful in completing the challenges.

# Command Line Instructions

You should literally copy-paste the commands when you see a box like this.
