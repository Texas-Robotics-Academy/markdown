# Installation Method

You will install using one of these two methods.

1. A virtual machine running in your host operating system.
2. A native Linux installation (because you already run Ubuntu 18.04).

You only need to choose *one* method of installing the Texas Robotics Academy software, but you *must* do one of these.

## Virtual Machine

Virtual machines allow users to run one operating system from inside another operating system.

Note, if you are running a new Mac with an M1 (ARM) chip, then you should follow the instructions for Parallels.

{{ site.data.alerts.note }}
You will need 20 GB of free hard drive space to use this method.

## Native Ubuntu 18.04 Installation

If you are already familiar with Ubuntu Linux, then this is the simplest method, but note that you *will need root access to install the Texas Robotics Academy software*.

{{ site.data.alerts.warning }}
You will need to be able to run *sudo* under Ubuntu 18.04 in order to use this method.

That means that if this is your parents' machine, you're going to need their help.

If you are running a different version of Linux, then install a virtual machine to run Ubuntu 18.04 under, with the help of the system's administrator.
