# Welcome to the Texas Robotics Academy!

I know that you're excited to get started. This is what we will go through in the first hour of the academy.

{{ site.data.alerts.note }}
I know that you want to dive right in. I do too. Please stay engaged with the icebreakers and generally "welcome" at the start. You will have ample time to program the robots.

1. On the first day of the academy, we will start with icebreakers.

2. At the start of every coding session, you will be instructed to go into breakout rooms.
    * Wait until you are told to go into your breakout room at the start of each session, as sometimes we will have announcements or lectures.
    * This room will change *every* session, so please check "Breakout Room: " on bar at the top of the website before joining a breakout.
    * Please join the breakout that you are instructed to join.

3. The academy is set up as a set of self-paced tutorials that you will go through with your instructor, Dr. Justin Hart, and the team of counselors.
    * This set of tutorials prepares you for robot programming challenges.

4. There will also be lectures and one-on-one instruction to help you through.

5. At the bottom of each complete a tutorial, challenge, or other activity, you will see a checkbox like the one below.
    * The first button is used to request help in completing the exercise.
    * The second button is used to indicate that you have completed the exercise, and need to have your work checked by a counselor for correctness.
    * The third button doesn't work for you. Counselors use it to indicate that you have completed the exercise.

7. You will have a counselor check your work at the end of each tutorial.
    * You may proceed to tutorials further along in the academy material while waiting for your work to be checked.
8. If you need help, aside from the checkpoints, click "Raise Hand" at the top of the page.
