*As an aside, having a table of contents here looks clunky since we only have one title. We should look into removing it if that's possible*

This site serves as your home base for reference material relating to the Texas RoboCamp and for the camp's tutorials and exercises.

**TODO** *Guide them towards the Before We Begin Part?*

*If you are just joining us, please procede to the Before We Begin tutorials for instructions on how to set up your machine.*

If this is the first day of camp, please procede to the "Welcome to Camp!" tutorial. (Found under "Welcome!/Welcome to Camp!") 

If you are returning, you should pick up where you left off. Clicking on the "Texas RoboCamp" logo at the top of the page will always bring you back here.


## Next Step

Proceed to ["Welcome to Camp!"](/welcome.html)

**TODO** *Do we want to send them to welcome to camp, or to the Before We Begin stuff? Or have links for both maybe?*
