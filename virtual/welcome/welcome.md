# Welcome to camp!


{{site.data.alerts.note}}
We know that you are excited to be here, and to finally be started on the exercises. If we are currently doing some group activity, like an icebreaker or group instruction, please pay attention to that and turn your attention back to the website when it has concluded. We promise that there will be ample time for these activities.

This week you will go through a mostly self-paced tutorial on how to program your robot. Your tutorial will be interspersed with instruction, challenges and activities on the robot, and lectures from scientists working in robotics. We have done everything that we could think of to pack as much fun as possible into this week.

First, a few preliminaries.



## Synchronizing Groups

There are some activities that we will do as one big group. For instance, sections of the tutorial are accompanied by brief lectures or group activities. Sections that are done as a group will be marked with a yellow box to indicate that you should wait to synchronize with the other campers.

This is just to show you what it looks like. Keep going.

## Tips

Sometimes we need to tell you something tangential to the line of thought of the tutorial, but important to point out. These will come in the form of "Tip", "Warning", "Note", and "Important. They will look something like this.

{{site.data.alerts.tip}}
Don't get distracted by the tips. They're intended to help you, not side-track you.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

## Command Line Instructions

Sometimes we just want you to type something into the computer and we just tell you what it is. You should literally copy-paste these commands when you see a box like this. The commands below are just an example of what they will look like.

{{site.data.alerts.terminal_commands}}
cd
ls
pwd

## Tutorials

The tutorials that you will be doing for this camp are self-paced and documented on this website. You can navigate the tutorials using the navigation bar on the left. You can always return to the top of the website by clicking on the "Texas RoboCamp" logo in the upper left-hand corner.

## Zoom Room Management

Every time you enter zoom, your assigned breakout room will change. This is so we can group campers together who are working on similar activities, so we can better help you as a group. If you decide you would like to stay with a certain counselor, please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate you. 

## Challenges and Activities

Tutorials prepare you for programming challenges and activities by providing you with the tools that you need in order to complete the task.

Once you have learned enough skills to solve a programming challenge or take part in an activity, the tutorial will present you with an activity or challenge to participate in.

Because the week is self-paced, it is up to you on how long you would like to spend on each activity. Be wary that some later activities and challenges build on skills that you develop in earlier ones, so make sure that you *do* complete each activity.

## Tracking your Progress

### Marking Your Progress and Asking for Help

There are various exercises you will complete throughout the week, and we do not expect you to be able to breeze through them without any questions. Along with each exercise you will see a red **Tutorial** bar, and there will be options to click if you want a counselor to come help you, or check off that exercise.

This is what they will look like:

{{+}}Tutorial 1, 1{{+}}

Whenever you click on one of these boxes, the counselors will be notified and one will come to assist you as soon as possible.

After you have completed an exercise, please do not move onto the next exercise until a counselor has come to check your work.

At this point, please mark your progress with the web interface.
