1. Look to the sidebar on the left-hand side of the page. See "Software Overview."
2. We need you to *try to* install the Robotics Academy software *prior to* the July 5 tech check.
3. Starting at "Softare Overview," we need you to proceed through a series of install instructions and choices all the way down to "Test Your Installation."

{{ site.data.alerts.tip }}
Get started early. This is likely to take you longer than you think it will and involve software that you are probably unfamiliar with.

There were delays in getting thumb drives delivered this year. If you don't get this done before tech inspection, that's okay!
