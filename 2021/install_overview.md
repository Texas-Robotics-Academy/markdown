# Software Overview
We will use several tools commonly used in robotics research.

* Ubuntu Linux - Ubuntu Linux is an open source operating system.
    * We will use Ubuntu 18.04
* ROS (Robot Operating System) - ROS is an open source middleware layer commonly used in robotics applications.
* Gazebo - Gazebo is a robot simulator which runs a simulated robot in a 3D virtual environment.

{{ site.data.alerts.warning }}
Ubuntu 18.04 is the only supported Linux version.

We provide multiple installation methods (including running in a virtual machine under Mac OS, Windows, or even other Linux versions).

We will not provide technical support for other versions of Linux or attempts to run under other operating systems.
