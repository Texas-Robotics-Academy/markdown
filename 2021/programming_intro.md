# Introduction to Programming

C++ is a programming language. Most of the applications you use are written in C++ or a similar language. You will write the programs to control your robot in C++.

A C++ program can be thought of as a list of instructions, in order, for the computer to carry out.

If you are already well-versed in programming, please complete the tutorials anyway. You should be able to do them quickly. For those of you who are new, please do not worry. You will be able to get through this material and program your robot!

Start by creating a step-by-step plan of what you want the computer to do. This plan is an called an algorithm.

The algorithm for making a bowl of cereal might be:

- Take bowl from cabinet
- Place bowl counter
- Take cereal from cabinet
- Open cereal
- Pour cereal from box into bowl until it almost reaches top of bowl
- Close box
- Put box in cabinet
- Open fridge
- Take milk from fridge
- Open milk
- Pour into bowl until cereal reaches top of bowl
- Close milk
- Put milk into fridge
- Take spoon from drawer
- Put spoon into bowl

Algorithms are detailed and exact. When you program, the language will enforce this.
