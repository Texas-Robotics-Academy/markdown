# Installing the Texas Robotics Academy Software

You have several options for installing the Texas RoboCamp software. *You only need to set up one of these things.*

1. A bootable thumb drive (which we are sending to you with everything pre-installed).
2. A virtual machine running in your host operating system.
3. A native Linux installation (either because you already run Ubuntu 18.04, or feel prepared to dual-boot your machine).

{{ site.data.alerts.note }}
You only need to choose *one* method of installing the Texas Robotics Academy software, but you *must* do one of these.

## Bootable Thumb Drive

If this works, this is the simplest method and the one which performs the best. Unfortunately, our students run a wide variety of hardware, and not all hardware will work with the thumb drive that we have sent.

If you would like to try this method. Click the link below.

{{-}}Running from a Thumb Drive, install_thumb_drive, Try{{-}}

## Virtual Machine

Virtual machines allow users to run one operating system from inside another operating system.

{{ site.data.alerts.note }}
You will need 20 GB of free hard drive space to use this method.

{{-}}Running from a Virtual Machine (Windows or Linux), install_virtual_machine_win, Try{{-}}

## Native Ubuntu 18.04 Installation

If you are already familiar with Ubuntu Linux, then this is the simplest method, but note that you *will need root access to install the Texas Robotics Academy software*.

{{ site.data.alerts.warning }}
You will need to be able to run *sudo* under Ubuntu 18.04 in order to use this method.

That means that if this is your parents' machine, you're going to need their help.
{{ site.data.alerts.end }}

If you are running a different version of Linux, then install a virtual machine to run Ubuntu 18.04 under, with the help of the system's administrator.

{{-}}Running from Ubuntu 18.04, install_linux, Try{{-}}
