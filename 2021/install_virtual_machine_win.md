10. Go to Display and uncheck “Accelerate 3D Graphics”
    * ...unless you have a discrete GPU. For example, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is a discrete GPU.
    * Try not to brag about your discrete GPU.
11. Save your settings and launch the VM
12. If prompted to Download/Install VMWare Tools or similar packages, download and install them.
13. Wait for installation to complete automatically, then log in and press next on all the prompts for the “Welcome to Ubuntu” window
    * If prompted to install Software Updates, just close the window.. or install them. We will do a step that installs them.

{{ site.data.alerts.tip }}
When starting the VM, you may get a message *“Cannot connect virtual device because no corresponding device is available on the host."* This is because your machine doesn't have a CD/DVD drive. Press no so that the VM will stop looking for the device upon startup.

You may get a similar message about a hard drive, especially under Linux. Generally, these are safe to ignore.

You will probably get a similar message about swap space. This is also safe to ignore.

You will know if the message is not safe to ignore because your VM will not start.

{{ site.data.alerts.tip }}
Ubuntu will also ask you several first-time setup questions. It's safe to click through "next" on all of them.
{{ site.data.alerts.end }}

Your screen should look something like this when your installation is complete.

Want Ubuntu full-screen? Hit ctrl-alt-enter.

Want it back in windowed mode? Do the same thing.
{{ site.data.alerts.end }}

{{ site.data.alerts.warning }}
Ubuntu will ask you if you want to upgrade to 20.04. *DON'T DO THIS!!* ROS Melodic will not run under 20.04, and thus the robot simulator for the camp will not work.
